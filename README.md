## Simulate Ctrl Alt Delete


</div>

### Description

Have you ever worried about a trojan running on your machine and hiding itself from the Ctrl Alt Delete window. I have created a program that acts like the Ctrl ALT Delete BUT you can't hide an EXE process from it. The app includes: Listing all active process, shows the path to the EXE, is it responding, and closing the process properly. My version uses a class developed by CHONG LONG CHOO (who by the way has some excellent API apps at this site) to list the active processes and some code taken from http://www.thescarms.com to close down the process. Check it out. It's a cool tool.
